# My CodeWar Challenges
Write a short sentence or two about this project and what it does. Be sure to include a link and a screenshot (we're front end devs so we can actually see our work!).

**Link to project:** https://github.com/CodingKiran/CodeWars



## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
Every day I will be taking a codewar challenge and pushing it to this repo. Intially, I'm taking beginner challenges and will progress towards more complex and diffcult challenges in the future. 




## Lessons Learned:

I love to see those green dots on my github profile and codewars have given me a opprotunity to put those green dots. With consistency, not only the green dots will fill up but your pockets too.  

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
